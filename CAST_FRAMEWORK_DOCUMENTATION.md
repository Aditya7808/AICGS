## Usage Examples

### Basic Translation
```python
from app.logic.cast_integration import CASTIntegratedMatcher
from app.logic.cast_framework.core import TranslationContext

# Initialize CAST Framework
cast_matcher = CASTIntegratedMatcher()

# Create translation context
context = TranslationContext(
    source_language="en",
    target_language="hi",
    cultural_region="north",
    content_type="career",
    user_demographics={},
    preserve_cultural_nuances=True
)

# Translate content
result = await cast_matcher.cast_framework.translate_career_content(
    "Software engineering offers excellent career opportunities", 
    context
)

print(f"Translated: {result.translated_text}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence_score}")
print(f"Cultural Adaptations: {result.cultural_adaptations}")
```

### Skills Analysis
```python
# Analyze skill portfolio
analysis = await cast_matcher.cast_framework.skills_mapper.analyze_skill_portfolio(
    skills=["programming", "communication", "teamwork"],
    cultural_context="south",
    target_industry="technology"
)

print(f"Cultural Alignment: {analysis['cultural_alignment']}")
print(f"Industry Relevance: {analysis['industry_relevance']}")
print(f"Recommendations: {analysis['recommendations']}")
```

### Bias Detection
```python
# Analyze content for bias
bias_analysis = await cast_matcher.cast_framework.bias_detector.analyze_content(
    "This career requires strong technical skills and is better suited for men",
    context
)

print(f"Bias Score: {bias_analysis['overall_bias_score']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {bias_analysis['risk_level']}")
print(f"Detected Biases: {len(bias_analysis['detected_biases'])}")
```

## Integration with CareerBuddy

### Assessment Questions Translation
```python
adapted_questions = await cast_matcher.get_culturally_adapted_assessment_questions(
    base_questions=assessment_questions,
    target_language="ta",
    cultural_region="south"
)
```

### Multilingual Recommendations
```python
recommendations = await cast_matcher.get_multilingual_career_recommendations(
    db_session=None,
    user_data=user_profile,
    target_language="hi",
    cultural_region="north"
)
```

### User Input Bias Analysis
```python
bias_analysis = await cast_matcher.analyze_user_input_bias(
    user_responses=user_assessment_data,
    cultural_context="west"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Translation
1. **Context Matters**: Always provide cultural context for better translations
2. **Quality Validation**: Check confidence scores and validate results
3. **Caching**: Use translation cache for repeated content
4. **Fallback**: Always have fallback mechanisms for failed translations

### Cultural Adaptation
1. **Region-Specific**: Adapt content for specific regional contexts
2. **Value Systems**: Respect local value systems and practices
3. **Communication Styles**: Match regional communication patterns
4. **Family Dynamics**: Consider family involvement in career decisions

### Bias Mitigation
1. **Proactive Detection**: Regular bias analysis of all content
2. **Inclusive Language**: Use gender-neutral, culturally inclusive language
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Consider diverse viewpoints in content creation
4. **Regular Updates**: Update bias patterns based on feedback
